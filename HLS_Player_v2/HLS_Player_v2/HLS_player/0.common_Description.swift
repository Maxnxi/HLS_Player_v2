 Custom Implementation:

 If you're experienced in
 networking and decoding video,
 you could create a custom solution using lower-level libraries
 - to download the manifest (.m3u8) and video segments,
 - then decode and display the video frames using Graphics frameworks such as Metal or OpenGL ES.
 
 
 Here's a concise analysis of AVPlayer's main functionality for playing HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) content in Swift:

1) Content loading:

 Accepts URLs for HLS playlists (.m3u8 files)

2) Playback control:

 Rate control (speed adjustment)


3) Buffer management:

 Preloads content for smooth playback
 Handles network fluctuations


4) Stream quality:

 Automatic switching between quality levels based on network conditions
 Manual control over preferred quality


5) Time observation:

 Current playback time
 Duration of the content


6) State management:

 Provides playback status (playing, paused, buffering, etc.)
 Offers notifications for state changes


7) Audio session handling:

 Integrates with iOS audio system
 Manages audio routing


8) Error handling:
